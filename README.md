UI displays movie selections and seats in a theater to choose from in order to purchase tickets

How it works:
1. UI dispays movie selections, screen, seats, legend and seat information
2. User can select a movie and its price
3. User can select and deselect seats
4. User can not select occupied seats
5. Number of seats and price will update

Seats, movie and price selected are saved on local storage so UI gets populated on refresh
